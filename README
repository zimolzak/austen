Take a bunch of text documents, assemble them into one corpus. Plot
the distribution of sentence length.

Run ./make.sh first.

Then use R to interpret logplot.R. Consider going line by line thru
plots. It doesn't pause.

I am running this on the complete works of Jane Austen, from Project
Gutenberg. make.sh expects files of names like "161 sense.doc". I
named them .DOC so Git can ignore them. But they are just plain text.

Internal details: make.sh will repeatedly run Perl that handles this:
(linebroken text --> CSV of sentence length).
